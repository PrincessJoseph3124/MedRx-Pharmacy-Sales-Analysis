## Sheet 2 — Clean Data

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Date` | Transaction date |
| `Long Month` | Full month name (e.g., January) |

| `Sales_Rep` | Cleaned representative name |
| `Units_Sold` | Numeric quantity sold |
| `Unit_Price` | Price per unit (₦) |
| `Revenue` | Gross revenue = Units × Unit Price |
| `Cost` | Cost of goods sold |
| `Profit` | Net profit = Revenue − Cost |
| `Profit_Margin` | Profit ÷ Revenue (decimal) |

**Cleaning Actions Applied:**

- Fixed inconsistent region names (`"Northern Nigerians"` → `"Northern Nigeria"`)
- Stripped extra whitespace from drug names and category labels
- Removed special characters from Sales Rep IDs and names
- Corrected corrupted Drug ID entries
- Converted currency-formatted cells to clean numeric values
- Normalized all column headers with underscores (no spaces)
- Added `Long Month`, `Month`, `Year`, and `Profit_Margin` as derived columns
